# The Eyes Bot Source Code
Written in discord.py

The bot has one function, reacting to messages which contain the ðŸ‘€ emote.

The bot also replies to messages which it is tagged in and contain certain content, for example, saying `@The ðŸ‘€ Bot#2810 good bot` will cause him DM you.

This was created more as a joke for a private server but everyone loved it and wanted to add it to their servers too - hence why I'm making it availible here.

Overall, it's a fun, memey bot which people seem to really love!

If you run into any issues using the bot, please join my discord and I can resolve your issues :)

# Default Commands:

`ðŸ‘€help` - This will show the help dialogue.

`ðŸ‘€blacklist` - Add yourself to the blacklist for the bot. This will prevent me from sending you Direct Messages.

`ðŸ‘€whitelist` - Remove yourself to the blacklist for the bot. This will allow me to send you Direct Messages.

`ðŸ‘€allowreplies true|false` - This will allow me to send messages into the server. Default: True.

`ðŸ‘€allowreactions true|false` - Allow bot to add reactions to messages. Default: True.

`ðŸ‘€allowdms true|false` - This will allow me to send direct messages to users when, for example, they say 'good bot' to me. Default: True.

`ðŸ‘€allowreactions true|false` - Allow bot to add reactions to messages. Default: True.

`ðŸ‘€allowedits true|false` - This will allow me to change reactions when messages are edited. Disabling this saves server capacity and helps keep latency low. Default: False.

`ðŸ‘€reset` - This will reset the config which has been set up.
