The bot has one function, reacting to messages which contain the ðŸ‘€ emote.

The bot also replies to messages which it is tagged in and contain certain content, for example, saying `@The ðŸ‘€ Bot#2810 good bot` will cause him DM you.

This was created more as a joke for a private server but everyone loved it and wanted to add it to their servers too - hence why I'm making it availible here.

Overall, it's a fun, memey bot which people seem to really love!

If you run into any issues using the bot, please join my discord and I can resolve your issues :)

Commands:

`ðŸ‘€help` - this will show the help dialogue

`ðŸ‘€blacklist` - this will prevent the bot from sending you direct messages (this must be sent in a DM)

`ðŸ‘€whitelist` - this will allow the bot to send you direct messages (must be sent in a DM)
