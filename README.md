#The Eyes Bot Source Code
Written in discord.py

This is an open source project. If you would like to make changes 

The bot has one function, reacting to messages which contain the ðŸ‘€ emote.

The bot also replies to messages which it is tagged in and contain certain content, for example, saying `@The ðŸ‘€ Bot#2810 good bot` will cause him DM you.

This was created more as a joke for a private server but everyone loved it and wanted to add it to their servers too - hence why I'm making it availible here.

Overall, it's a fun, memey bot which people seem to really love!

If you run into any issues using the bot, please join my discord and I can resolve your issues :)
